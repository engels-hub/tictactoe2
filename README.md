# TicTactoe

Hi! ðŸ‘‹

This is a mid-term project for my uni course, a game of TicTactoe, written in Kotlin. The intention was to use as less as possible external sources (LLMs, StackOverFlow etc.)


## Features

- Drawn-on-paper aesthetic
- Player names caching
- PvP and PvC mode
- Greeting on home page
- 5 unique types of noughts and crosses



## Screenshots

 - A couple of screenshots of the app:
